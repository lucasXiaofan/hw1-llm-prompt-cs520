This gives the exact count of subarrays with exactly `K` distinct integers.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Approach**:\n   - Define a helper function `atMostK(A, K)` that calculates the number of subarrays with at most `K` distinct integers using a sliding window technique.\n   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the array.\n   - Use a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the frequency of elements within the current window.\n   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer:\n     - Update the frequency count of `A[right]` in the hash map.\n     - If the number of distinct elements in the hash map exceeds `K`, contract the window from the `left`:\n       - Decrement the count of `A[left]` in the hash map.\n       - If the count reaches zero, remove it from the hash map.\n       - Increment `left` to reduce the window size.\n     - The number of valid subarrays ending at `right` is `right - left + 1`.

The solution involves tracking the state of each frog as it progresses through the letters of \"croak\" and ensuring that the sequence is valid.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Valid Sequence**: The total number of each character in the string must be balanced. Specifically, the counts of 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k' must all be equal. If they are not, the sequence is invalid, and we return -1.\n\n2. **Track Frog States**: As we process each character in the string, we need to track how many frogs are at each stage of the croak sequence. The stages are:\n   - 'c' indicates a new croak has started (a new frog might be needed).\n   - 'r' must follow 'c' (i.e., there should be a frog that has just said 'c').\n   - 'o' must follow 'r', and so on for 'a' and 'k'.\n   - When a frog reaches 'k', it completes the croak and can be reused for another 'c'.\n\n3. **Count Active Frogs**: For each character, update the counts of frogs in each state. The maximum number of frogs active at any point (i.e., frogs that have started but not yet finished their croak) gives the minimum number of frogs needed.\n\n### Solution Plan\n1. **Initialize Counters**: Create a dictionary or an array to keep track of the counts of each character ('c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k') encountered so far.\n\n2. **Check Character Balance**: After processing the entire string, verify that the counts of 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k' are all equal. If not, return -1.\n\n3. **Process Each Character**: For each character in the string:\n   - **'c'**: Increment the count of frogs in the 'c' stage. The number of active frogs is current 'c' frogs minus those that have completed ('k' frogs). Track the maximum active frogs encountered.\n   - **'r'**: Decrement the 'c' count and increment the 'r' count. Ensure that 'c' count was positive before this step; otherwise, the sequence is invalid.\n   - **'o'**: Similarly, decrement 'r' and increment 'o', checking validity.\n   - **'a'**: Decrement 'o' and increment 'a', checking validity.\n   - **'k'**: Decrement 'a' and increment 'k'. This indicates a frog has completed its croak. The 'k' count helps in determining how many frogs can be reused.\n\n4. **Check Validity During Processing**: For each step after 'c', ensure the previous character's count is positive before proceeding. If not, the sequence is invalid, and we return -1.\n\n5. **Determine Minimum Frogs**: The maximum value of (active frogs) during processing gives the minimum number of frogs needed. Active frogs at any point are the frogs that have started but not finished (i.e., sum of frogs in stages 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a').\n\n6. **Return Result**: After processing all characters, if all checks pass, return the maximum active frogs encountered. If any check fails, return -1.\n\n### Key Points\n- The solution ensures that the sequence of characters follows the valid \"croak\" order for each frog.\n- The counts of each character must balance at the end, ensuring all started croaks are completed.\n- The active frogs at any point are tracked to determine the minimum frogs needed concurrently.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for validity and computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.",

The index of this pivot is important because it indicates where the sequence starts to decrease, allowing us to find the next greater number.\n\n3. **Check for No Pivot**:\n   - If no such pivot is found (i.e., the digits are in non-increasing order from left to right), it means the number is already the largest possible permutation of its digits. In this case, return -1.\n\n4. **Find the Swap Candidate**:\n   - From the end of the list again, find the smallest digit that is larger than the pivot digit.

If it exceeds the maximum value (2^31 - 1), return -1.\n\n9. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the newly formed integer if it is valid; otherwise, return -1.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\nFor `n = 12`:\n1. Digits: [1, 2]\n2. Pivot: 1 (at index 0)\n3. Swap candidate: 2 (at index 1)\n4. Swap to get [2, 1]\n5. Reverse suffix (none to reverse after pivot)\n6. Result: 21 (valid and within 32-bit range)\n\nFor `n = 21`:\n1. Digits: [2, 1]\n2. No pivot found (digits are in non-increasing order)\n3. Return -1\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the next greater number by leveraging the properties of digit permutations and ensures the result is the smallest possible valid number greater than `n`.",

          "thinking": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of moments when all the bulbs that are turned on are blue. A bulb turns blue if it is on and all the bulbs to its left are also on. The key observation here is that at any moment `k`, all the turned-on bulbs will be blue if the first `k+1` bulbs (1 to `k+1`) are turned on by that moment. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Track the Rightmost Turned-On Bulb**: For each moment `k` (0-based index), we need to check if the rightmost bulb turned on so far is equal to the number of bulbs turned on (i.e., `k+1`). If they are equal, it means all bulbs from 1 to `k+1` are turned on, so all the currently turned-on bulbs are blue.\n2. **Count Valid Moments**: Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum bulb number turned on so far. For each bulb turned on at position `i` in the `light` array, update this maximum. If the maximum value equals the current number of bulbs turned on (i.e., `i+1`), increment the count of valid moments.\n\n### Solution Plan\n1. **Initialize Variables**: \n   - `max_bulb` to keep track of the highest-numbered bulb turned on so far.\n   - `count` to count the number of valid moments where all turned-on bulbs are blue.\n2. **Iterate Through Each Moment**:\n   - For each bulb turned on at position `i` (0-based) in the `light` array, update `max_bulb` to be the maximum of its current value and the bulb number being turned on (`light[i]`).\n   - Check if `max_bulb` equals `i+1` (since `i+1` bulbs have been processed by moment `i`). If true, increment `count`.\n3. **Return the Result**: After processing all moments, return `count` as the result.\n\n### Explanation\n- **Tracking the Rightmost Bulb**: The idea is that the rightmost bulb turned on up to moment `k` must be exactly `k+1` for all bulbs from 1 to `k+1` to be on. This ensures that there are no gaps in the sequence of bulbs turned on, which is necessary for all bulbs to be blue.\n- **Example**: For `light = [2,1,3,5,4]`, the moments are:\n  - Moment 0: Turn on bulb 2. `max_bulb = 2`. Check if 2 == 1? No.\n  - Moment 1: Turn on bulb 1. `max_bulb = 2`. Check if 2 == 2? Yes. Count becomes 1.\n  - Moment 2: Turn on bulb 3. `max_bulb = 3`. Check if 3 == 3? Yes. Count becomes 2.\n  - Moment 3: Turn on bulb 5. `max_bulb = 5`. Check if 5 == 4? No.\n  - Moment 4: Turn on bulb 4. `max_bulb = 5`. Check if 5 == 5? Yes. Count becomes 3.\n  - The result is 3, which matches the example.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each moment in linear time, making it optimal for the given constraints.",

Update `max_length` to `i + 1`.\n   - If the `score` is not greater than 0, check if `score - 1` exists in `score_indices`.
