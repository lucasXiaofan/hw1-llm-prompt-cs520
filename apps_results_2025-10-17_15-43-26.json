        "thinking": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of contiguous subarrays in an array that contain exactly K distinct integers. The solution involves using a sliding window approach combined with a hash map to keep track of the distinct elements efficiently. Here's a step-by-step solution plan:\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to count all contiguous subarrays where the number of distinct integers is exactly K. A brute-force approach would involve checking every possible subarray, but it would be inefficient for large arrays. Instead, we can use a sliding window technique to efficiently count these subarrays.\n2. **Sliding Window Concept**: The idea is to use the concept of at most K distinct elements minus at most K-1 distinct elements to get the exact count of subarrays with exactly K distinct elements. This approach simplifies the problem by converting it into two separate problems involving counting subarrays with at most K distinct elements.\n3. **Sliding Window Implementation**: To count the number of subarrays with at most K distinct elements, we maintain a sliding window (left and right pointers) that expands and contracts based on the number of distinct elements encountered. Every time the window contains more than K distinct elements, we move the left pointer to the right until the number of distinct elements is within the desired limit.\n4. **Tracking Distinct Elements**: Use a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the frequency of each element within the current window. This helps in efficiently updating the count of distinct elements when elements are added or removed from the window.\n5. **Calculating the Result**: The result for the original problem is the difference between the number of subarrays with at most K distinct elements and the number of subarrays with at most K-1 distinct elements.\n\n### Solution Plan\n1. **Define Helper Function**: Create a helper function `atMostK(A, K)` that returns the number of subarrays with at most K distinct elements.\n   - Initialize variables: left pointer (left), result (count), and a frequency dictionary (freq).\n   - Iterate through the array with the right pointer, updating the frequency of the current element.\n   - If the number of distinct elements exceeds K, move the left pointer to the right, updating the frequency dictionary, until the number of distinct elements is at most K.\n   - Update the count by adding the length of the current window (right - left + 1).\n2. **Calculate Result**: Use the helper function to compute the result as `atMostK(A, K) - atMostK(A, K-1)`. This gives the exact count of subarrays with exactly K distinct elements.\n3. **Return the Result**: Return the computed result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the sliding window technique and reduces the problem to two simpler subproblems, thereby optimizing the solution.",

The solution involves a systematic approach to identify the next permutation of the digits in `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert the number to a list of digits**: This allows us to manipulate each digit individually.\n2. **Find the pivot**: The pivot is the first digit from the end of the list that is smaller than the digit immediately after it. This identifies the point where the sequence starts to decrease, which is crucial for finding the next greater permutation.\n3. **Find the swap candidate**: Once the pivot is found, we look for the smallest digit greater than the pivot digit from the end of the list to the pivot's position.\n4. **Swap the pivot with the swap candidate**: This ensures the next greater number starts with the smallest possible increment.\n5. **Reverse the suffix**: After swapping, the digits after the pivot's original position should be in ascending order to ensure the smallest possible number is formed.\n6. **Convert the list of digits back to a number**: Check if the new number is within the 32-bit signed integer range.
