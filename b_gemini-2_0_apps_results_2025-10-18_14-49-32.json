          "thinking": "STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND: The problem defines 'unhappy' friends based on their preferences and pairings. We need to iterate through each friend, check if they are unhappy, and count the total number of unhappy friends. The core logic involves comparing preferences between paired friends and other potential friends. The input includes the number of friends, their preferences, and the existing pairs. The output is the count of unhappy friends. Constraints include the size of n, the structure of preferences and pairs, and the uniqueness of friends in preferences. STEP 2 - PLAN: 1. Create a dictionary to store the pairs for easy lookup. 2. Iterate through each person 'x'. 3. For each person 'x', find their partner 'y'. 4. Iterate through all other people 'u'. 5. If 'u' is not 'x' and not 'y', find 'u's partner 'v'. 6. Check if 'x' prefers 'u' over 'y' AND 'u' prefers 'x' over 'v'. If both conditions are true, then 'x' is unhappy. 7. Keep track of the unhappy friends using a set to avoid double-counting. 8. Return the size of the set of unhappy friends. Time complexity: O(n^3) because of the nested loops. Space complexity: O(n) for the pairs dictionary and the unhappy set. STEP 3 - EDGE CASES: n = 2, should return 0 if the preferences are mutual. n = 4, the example cases are good. n = large, the algorithm should still work, but might be slow.

          "thinking": "STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND: The problem asks to find the minimum number of operations (+, -, *, /) to express a target number using only the number x. The operations must follow the order of operations (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction), and no parentheses or unary negation are allowed. The division operator returns rational numbers. The input x is between 2 and 100, and the target is between 1 and 2 * 10^8.\n\nSTEP 2 - PLAN: We can use dynamic programming or recursion with memoization to solve this problem. The key idea is to express the target as a sum or difference of powers of x. Let's consider the powers of x: x^0, x^1, x^2, ... We want to find coefficients c_i such that target = c_0 * x^0 + c_1 * x^1 + c_2 * x^2 + ... The cost of using x^i is i. We can use either addition or subtraction for each term. We can define a recursive function dp(i, target) that returns the minimum number of operations to express the target using powers of x up to x^i. The base case is when target = 0, the cost is 0. When i = 0, the cost is target if target is an integer, otherwise infinity. The recursive step is to consider all possible coefficients c_i for x^i. We can express target as target = c_i * x^i + remaining_target. Then, remaining_target = target - c_i * x^i. We can also express target as target = c_i * x^i - remaining_target. Then, remaining_target = c_i * x^i - target. We want to minimize the cost, which is i * (c_i - 1) + dp(i-1, remaining_target) + (c_i - 1) if c_i > 0, or dp(i-1, target) if c_i = 0. We can iterate through all possible values of c_i and choose the one that minimizes the cost. Since x is between 2 and 100, and target is between 1 and 2 * 10^8, we can limit the maximum power of x to be log_x(target). We can use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nSTEP 3 - EDGE CASES: x = 2, target = 1. The answer is 1 (2 / 2). x = 3, target = 1. The answer is 1 (3 / 3). x = 2, target = 2. The answer is 0 (2). x = 2, target = 3. The answer is 2 (2 + 2 / 2 or 2 * 2 - 2 / 2). x = 3, target = 19. The answer is 5 (3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3). x = 5, target = 501. The answer is 8 (5 * 5 * 5 * 5 - 5 * 5 * 5 + 5 / 5). x = 100, target = 100000000. The answer is 3 (100 * 100 * 100 * 100).\n\nSTEP 4 - IMPLEMENT:",
