Examples show that subarrays can overlap and be of varying lengths. Constraints indicate that A can be large (up to 20,000 elements), so the solution must be efficient. STEP 2 - PLAN: Use a sliding window approach with two pointers to efficiently count subarrays. The idea is to maintain a window that contains at most K distinct integers and use a helper function to count subarrays with at most K distinct integers. The result is the difference between the count of subarrays with at most K distinct integers and the count of subarrays with at most K-1 distinct integers.

        "thinking": "To solve the problem of finding the number of subarrays with exactly K distinct integers, we can use a sliding window approach combined with a hash map to keep track of the frequency of elements. Here’s a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a helper function**: Create a helper function `atMostK(A, K)` that calculates the number of subarrays with at most K distinct integers.\n\n2. **Sliding window with two pointers**: In the helper function, use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window. Initialize both pointers to 0.\n\n3. **Hash map for frequency tracking**: Use a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the frequency of elements within the current window.\n\n4. **Expand the window**: Move the `right` pointer to the right, expanding the window. For each new element, update its frequency in the hash map.\n\n5. **Shrink the window if necessary**: If the number of distinct elements in the window exceeds K, move the `left` pointer to the right, shrinking the window. Update the frequency of the element at the `left` pointer in the hash map and remove it if its frequency drops to zero.\n\n6. **Count valid subarrays**: For each valid window (with at most K distinct elements), the number of subarrays ending at the `right` pointer is `right - left + 1`. Accumulate this count.\n\n7. **Calculate the result**: The number of subarrays with exactly K distinct integers is the difference between the number of subarrays with at most K distinct integers and the number of subarrays with at most K-1 distinct integers. This can be expressed as `atMostK(A, K) - atMostK(A, K-1)`.\n\n8. **Return the result**: Return the calculated result as the final answer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the subarrays with exactly K distinct integers using a sliding window and frequency tracking.",
