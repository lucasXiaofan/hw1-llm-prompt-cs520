          "thinking": "STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND: The input is a triangle represented as a list of lists, where each row has one more element than the previous. The goal is to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom, moving to adjacent numbers (same index or next index) on the row below. The example shows a path sum of 11 (2 + 3 + 5 + 1). STEP 2 - PLAN: Use dynamic programming to solve this efficiently. Start from the bottom row and work upwards, updating each element to be the sum of itself plus the minimum of the two adjacent elements from the row below. This approach uses O(n) space where n is the number of rows. Time complexity is O(n^2) since we process each element once. STEP 3 - EDGE CASES: Single-row triangle (return the only element). Triangle with negative numbers. Triangle with all identical numbers (path sum is straightforward). STEP 4 - IMPLEMENT: Initialize a DP array with the last row of the triangle. For each row above, update the DP array by adding the current element to the minimum of the two adjacent elements from the row below.",
