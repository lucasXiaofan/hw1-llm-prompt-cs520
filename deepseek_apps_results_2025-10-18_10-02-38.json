          "thinking": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of pizza slices you can pick under the given constraints. The key observation is that the problem reduces to selecting a subset of non-adjacent elements in a circular array that maximizes the sum, with the additional constraint that the total number of selected elements is exactly one-third of the array length (since you and your friends take turns, and the process stops when all slices are taken).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is similar to the House Robber problem but with a circular array and a constraint on the number of elements selected. Specifically, you need to select k non-adjacent elements from a circular array of length 3k (since slices.length % 3 == 0) that maximizes the sum. The circular nature means the first and last elements cannot be selected together.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The approach involves solving two separate linear problems:\n   - **Case 1**: Exclude the last element and solve for the first n-1 elements to select k elements.\n   - **Case 2**: Exclude the first element and solve for the last n-1 elements to select k elements.\n   The solution will be the maximum of these two cases.\n\n3. **DP State Definition**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum sum achievable by selecting `j` elements from the first `i` elements without picking adjacent elements.\n\n4. **DP Transition**: For each element at position `i` and for each possible count `j` of selected elements up to the required k:\n   - If you pick the i-th element, you cannot pick the (i-1)-th element, so the sum is `dp[i-2][j-1] + slices[i]`.\n   - If you don't pick the i-th element, the sum remains `dp[i-1][j]`.\n   The DP transition is the maximum of these two options.\n\n5. **Initialization**: Initialize the DP table with zeros. The base case is `dp[0][1] = slices[0]` for the first element when selecting one element.\n\n6. **Result Calculation**: After filling the DP tables for both cases (excluding the first or last element), the result is the maximum value between the two cases.\n\n### Solution Plan\n1. **Determine k**: Calculate `k` as `len(slices) / 3` since you can pick exactly one-third of the slices.\n2. **Case 1 Handling**: Solve the problem for the array `slices[0:-1]` (excluding the last element) to avoid circular adjacency.\n   - Initialize a DP table `dp` of size `(n) x (k+1)` where `n` is the length of the array.\n   - Fill the DP table using the transitions:\n     - For each `i` from 1 to n-1:\n       - For each `j` from 1 to k:\n         - `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-2][j-1] + slices[i])` if `i >= 1` and `j >= 1`.\n   - The result for this case is `dp[n-1][k]`.\n3. **Case 2 Handling**: Solve the problem for the array `slices[1:]` (excluding the first element).\n   - Repeat the same DP process as in Case 1.\n   - The result for this case is `dp[n-1][k]`.\n4. **Return the Maximum**: The final answer is the maximum value obtained from Case 1 and Case 2.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular constraint by breaking it into two linear problems and ensures that the solution adheres to the adjacency and selection count constraints.",

The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of valid permutations without resorting to brute force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We will use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid permutations of the first `i+1` numbers (0 to i) ending with the number `j` that satisfy the first `i` characters of the string S.\n2. **Initialization**: For the base case when the sequence is empty (i=0), there's only one permutation, which is the single number 0. Thus, `dp[0][0] = 1`.\n3. **DP Transitions**:\n   - **For 'I' (Increasing)**: If the current character is 'I', the next number in the permutation must be larger than the last number. Therefore, for each position `i` and possible ending number `j`, the next number can be any number greater than `j` up to `i+1`. The DP value is updated by summing all valid previous states where the last number was less than `j`.\n   - **For 'D' (Decreasing)**: If the current character is 'D', the next number must be smaller than the last number. Thus, for each position `i` and possible ending number `j`, the next number can be any number less than `j` down to 0. The DP value is updated by summing all valid previous states where the last number was greater than or equal to `j`.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations should be performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the sum of all possible ending numbers in the DP table after processing the entire string S.\n\n### Solution Plan\n1. **Initialize DP Table**: Create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` initialized to 0, where `n` is the length of the string S. Set `dp[0][0] = 1` as the base case.\n2. **Process Each Character**:\n   - For each character in S (from index 0 to n-1), determine whether it is 'I' or 'D'.\n   - For each possible position `i` (from 1 to n) and each possible ending number `j` (from 0 to i):\n     - **If 'I'**: The next number must be larger than `j`. Thus, for each `k` from `j+1` to `i+1`, add `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i+1][k]`.\n     - **If 'D'**: The next number must be smaller than `j`. Thus, for each `k` from 0 to `j-1`, add `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i+1][k]`.\n3. **Summing Results**: After processing all characters, the result is the sum of `dp[n][j]` for all `j` from 0 to n, taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Key Points\n- The DP approach efficiently breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, avoiding the exponential complexity of a brute-force solution.\n- The transitions between states carefully account for the constraints imposed by each 'I' or 'D' in the sequence.\n- Modulo operations ensure that numbers remain manageable and prevent overflow.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of valid permutations by leveraging dynamic programming to build up the solution step by step, respecting the constraints given by the sequence S.",

STEP 3 - EDGE CASES: When target is equal to x, the operator count is 0. When target is less than x, we need to use addition or subtraction. When target is a multiple of x, multiplication or division can be used. When target is 1, we need to use division (x / x).

Let’s denote these counts as `count_7`, `count_8`, and `count_9`.\n\n4. **Define the Correct Positions**:\n   - The first `count_7` positions should be 7s.\n   - The next `count_8` positions should be 8s.\n   - The remaining positions should be 9s.\n\n5. **Identify Misplaced Elements**:\n   - Iterate through the sequence and identify elements that are not in their correct positions based on the above definition.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Swaps**:\n   - For each misplaced element, determine the correct position and perform a swap if necessary.\n   - Keep track of the number of swaps performed.\n\n7. **Optimize Swaps**:\n   - When swapping, prioritize correcting multiple misplaced elements in a single swap if possible.\n   - For example, if a 7 is in the 8s section and an 8 is in the 7s section, swapping them corrects both elements in one operation.\n\n8. **Return the Total Number of Swaps**:\n   - After correcting all misplaced elements, return the total number of swaps performed.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nFor `sequence = [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]`:\n\n1. Counts: `count_7 = 2`, `count_8 = 3`, `count_9 = 4`.\n2. Correct positions: First 2 positions should be 7s, next 3 should be 8s, last 4 should be 9s.\n3. Identify misplaced elements:\n   - Positions 0 and 1 should be 7s but are 8s.\n   - Position 2 should be 7 but is 7 (correct).\n   - Positions 3, 4, 5 should be 8s but are 9s.\n   - Position 6 should be 8 but is 8 (correct).\n   - Positions 7 and 8 should be 9s but are 9 and 7 respectively.\n4. Perform swaps:\n   - Swap position 0 (8) with position 2 (7) → Corrects position 0.\n   - Swap position 1 (8) with position 8 (7) → Corrects position 1.\n   - Swap position 3 (9) with position 6 (8) → Corrects position 3.\n   - Swap position 4 (9) with position 7 (9) → Corrects position 4.\n5. Total swaps: 4.\n\nThis plan ensures the sequence is sorted with the minimum number of exchange operations.",

          "thinking": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of a triangle where each step moves to an adjacent number on the row below. The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum path sum by building up the solution from the bottom of the triangle to the top.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Structure**: The triangle is structured such that each number in a row is adjacent to two numbers in the row below (except for the numbers at the ends of the rows). The goal is to find the path from the top to the bottom that minimizes the sum of the numbers along the path.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the minimum path sums for subproblems. The idea is to start from the bottom row and work upwards, updating each position in the row above to reflect the minimum path sum achievable from that position to the bottom.\n\n3. **Bottom-Up Processing**: \n   - **Initialization**: Start with the bottom row of the triangle as the initial DP state since the minimum path sum for each element in the bottom row is the element itself.\n   - **DP State Update**: For each subsequent row above, update each element by adding the current element's value to the minimum of the two adjacent elements in the row below. This represents choosing the path with the lesser sum.\n   - **Result Extraction**: After processing all rows, the top element of the DP array will contain the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.\n\n4. **Space Optimization**: The DP approach can be optimized to use O(n) space, where n is the number of rows, by updating the DP array in place as we process each row.\n\n### Solution Plan\n1. **Initialize the DP Array**: Start with the last row of the triangle as the initial DP array.\n2. **Iterate from the Second Last Row to the Top**:\n   - For each element in the current row, update the DP value at that position to be the sum of the current element and the minimum of the two adjacent DP values from the row below.\n3. **Return the Result**: After processing all rows, the first element of the DP array will hold the minimum path sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        if not triangle:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Start from the second last row and move upwards\n        for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):\n            for col in range(len(triangle[row])):\n                triangle[row][col] += min(triangle[row + 1][col], triangle[row + 1][col + 1])\n        \n        return triangle[0][0]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP array is initialized as the last row of the triangle. This is because the minimum path sum for each element in the last row is the element itself, as there are no further rows below.\n2. **Bottom-Up Processing**: Starting from the second last row, each element in the current row is updated by adding the current element's value to the minimum of the two adjacent elements in the row below. This step effectively builds the solution from the bottom up, ensuring that each element in the DP array represents the minimum path sum from that position to the bottom.\n3. **Result Extraction**: After processing all rows, the top element of the triangle (or the DP array) contains the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom, which is returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum path sum using dynamic programming with O(n) space complexity (by modifying the input triangle in place), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. The time complexity is O(n^2) as each element in the triangle is processed exactly once.",
