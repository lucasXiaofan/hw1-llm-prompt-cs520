The selection process involves alternating turns between you and your friends, with specific rules for picking slices. The input is a list of integers representing slice sizes, and the output is the maximum sum of slices you can pick. The constraints ensure the list length is a multiple of 3 and within a manageable range. STEP 2 - PLAN: This problem can be modeled as a variant of the House Robber problem, where you cannot select adjacent elements. Since the array is circular, we need to consider two scenarios: one where the first element is included and the last is excluded, and vice versa. We can use dynamic programming to solve this. The DP approach involves creating a table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum achievable with the first i slices and j selections. We iterate through the slices and update the DP table based on whether we include or exclude the current slice. STEP 3 - EDGE CASES: Empty list (not possible due to constraints). Single element (not possible due to constraints). All elements are the same. Elements are in increasing or decreasing order.

Format the remaining letters into the required substring format. Sort the substrings first by length in descending order, then lexicographically. Finally, join the sorted substrings with '/'.

The value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. We need to consider the effect of reversing any possible subarray on the total value. Reversing a subarray changes the differences at its boundaries and leaves internal differences unaffected (since they just get reversed). STEP 2 - PLAN: The main observation is that reversing a subarray only affects the differences at its endpoints. The maximum gain can be obtained by maximizing the changes at these endpoints. We need to consider four cases involving the boundaries of the original array and potential subarray endpoints. The optimal solution involves checking all possible candidates for the maximum gain and adding it to the original sum. Time complexity is O(n) since we scan the array a few times. Space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few variables. STEP 3 - EDGE CASES: Single element array → return 0. Entire array reversed → check if reversing helps. Small arrays → handle manually.

The sequence is already sorted if all 7s come first, followed by 8s, then 9s. The challenge is to count the minimum swaps needed to achieve this order.\n\nSTEP 2 - PLAN: The optimal approach involves counting misplaced elements in each segment of the sequence. The sequence can be divided into three segments: 7s, 8s, and 9s. For each segment, count how many elements don't belong there. The number of swaps can be derived from these counts. Specifically, the number of swaps is the sum of misplaced elements in the 7s and 8s segments, minus the overlaps where a 7 is in the 8s segment and an 8 is in the 7s segment (these can be fixed with a single swap).\n\nSTEP 3 - EDGE CASES: Empty sequence (should return 0).
