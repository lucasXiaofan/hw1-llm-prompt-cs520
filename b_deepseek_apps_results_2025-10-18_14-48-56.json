For example, `target = a * x^k + b * x^(k-1) + ... + c`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Cost**: For each power of `x`, calculate the cost (number of operators) required to represent it. The cost for `x^k` is `k` (since it requires `k` multiplications), and the cost for `1/x^k` is `k + 1` (since it requires `k` multiplications and one division).\n\n5. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operators required to reach the `target`. Define a DP table where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operators needed to reach the value `i`.\n\n6. **Initialize the DP Table**: Start with `dp[1] = 1` (since `x^0 = 1` requires no operators) and `dp[x] = 1` (since `x^1` requires one operator).\n\n7. **Fill the DP Table**: For each value `i` from `1` to `target`, calculate the minimum number of operators required by considering all possible combinations of `x^k` and `1/x^k` that can sum up to `i`.\n\n8. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that the solution handles edge cases such as `target = x`, `target = 1`, and large values of `target`.\n\n9. **Return the Result**: The value `dp[target]` will give the minimum number of operators required to reach the `target`.\n\n10. **Optimize for Large Targets**: For large values of `target`, consider using memoization or pruning to reduce the computational complexity.",
